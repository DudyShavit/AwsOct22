# Hello World EC2

### Before you begin  

You need to have an AWS account with web console access. Our shared AWS account is:
<a href="https://964849360084.signin.aws.amazon.com/console" target="_blank">https://488587609044.signin.aws.amazon.com/console</a>. Login with your full mail as username.

## TL;DR

1. Create an EC2 instance, as follows:
   1. `Microsoft Windows Server 2019` AMI.
   2. `t2.medium` instance type  (or equivalent medium type from another generation).
   3. Choose your key-pair (create if needed).
   4. All other configurations are  default. 
2. Your instance should have a public ip4v address. Connect to your instance via RDP by click on **Connect** button in the instance summary page, then RDP Client. 
3. Configure IIS web server and serve simple Hello World page (make sure the appropriate port is open in the instanceâ€™s security group).

## Launch an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the **Launch instance** box, choose **Launch instance**, and then choose **Launch instance** from the options that appear\.

1. Under **Name and tags**, for **Name**, enter a descriptive name for your instance (that can be identifiable by the group)\.

1. Under **Application and OS Images \(Amazon Machine Image\)**, do the following:

   1. Choose **Quick Start**, and then choose Windows\. This is the operating system \(OS\) for your instance\.

   1. From **Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)**, select the AMI for Windows Server 2019\.

1. Under **Instance type**, from the **Instance type** list, Choose the `t2.medium` instance type (or equivalent machine). 

1. Under **Key pair \(login\)**, for **Key pair name**, choose the key pair that you created, or create a new one.

1. Keep the default selections for the other configuration settings for your instance\.

1. Review a summary of your instance configuration in the **Summary** panel, and when you're ready, choose **Launch instance**\.

1. On the **Instances** screen, you can view the status of the launch\. It takes a short time for an instance to launch\. When you launch an instance, its initial state is `pending`\. After the instance starts, its state changes to `running` and it receives a public DNS name\.

1. It can take a few minutes for the instance to be ready for you to connect to it\. Check that your instance has passed its status checks; you can view this information in the **Status check** column\.

## Connect to your instance

1. In the navigation pane, select **Instances**\. Select the instance and then choose **Connect**\.

1. On the **Connect to instance** page, choose the **RDP client** tab, and then choose **Get password**\.

1. Choose **Browse** and navigate to the private key \(`.pem`\) file you created when you launched the instance\. Select the file and choose **Open** to copy the entire contents of the file to this window\.
