2. [Create a volume snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html#ebs-create-snapshot) of your unencrypted EBS.
3. Create encrypted EBS from the EBS snapshot. Use the encrypted keys youâ€™ve just created in KMS.
4. Attach and mount the encrypted volume to your instance. Make sure the data from the unencrypted volume has been migrated successfully to the encrypted volume.
